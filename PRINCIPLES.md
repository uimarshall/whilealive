# FLEXBOX

> > We have the flex container which behaves as a parent container to the flex items which acts as children.

> > The elements inside the flex container are the flex items and are flexible as a result of the parent container being declared as flex.

> > We use some classes to control how the flex items behaves inside the flex container, e.g. positioning, how they grow or shrink etc.
>
> ## flex-grow:

It means the growth rate of each flex items, at what rate should it grow wrt to the parent container?

> It's a child property and takes numerical values to indicate the growth rate.

> e.g flex-grow: 1
>
> The growth is applied to the width of the flex items, which makes them to out-grow their default or defined min-width.

## flex-wrap

> It's a parent property (flex-container), It helps to wrap the child element into the next line, once the flex item falls below it's min-width.
